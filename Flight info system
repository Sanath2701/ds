1. Create a Hive Database
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE DATABASE mydb2;
USE mydb2;
Creates and switches to a new Hive database.

2. Create Table flight

CREATE TABLE flight (
  fno INT,
  year INT,
  dest VARCHAR(10),
  delay FLOAT
);
Creates a basic flight table with flight number, year, destination, and delay.

3. Alter Table
Rename table:


ALTER TABLE flight RENAME TO air_flight;
Add column:


ALTER TABLE air_flight ADD COLUMNS (source VARCHAR(10));
Modifies the existing table to rename it and add a new column.

4. Drop Table

DROP TABLE flight;
Deletes the table flight.

5. Describe Table

DESC air_flight;
Shows structure of the table.

6. Create table with file format

CREATE TABLE flight (
  fno INT,
  year INT,
  dest VARCHAR(10),
  delay FLOAT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
Creates a table with file format definitions for loading from a CSV-like file.

7. Insert Data

INSERT INTO flight VALUES (123, 2001, 'mumbai', 30.6);
INSERT INTO flight VALUES (124, 2001, 'pune', 18.5);
Inserts values into the flight table.

8. View Table Contents

SELECT * FROM flight;
Displays data from the table.

9. Load Data from File

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'f.txt' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE flight;
Loads data from a local file into the flight table.

10. Join Tables

CREATE TABLE nflight (
  fno INT,
  year INT,
  source VARCHAR(10)
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

INSERT INTO nflight VALUES (123, 2001, 'pune');

SELECT a.fno, a.year, a.dest, a.delay, b.source
FROM flight a JOIN nflight b
ON (a.fno = b.fno);
Performs a join between flight and nflight on flight number.

11. Check Unique Record Using Index

CREATE INDEX flight_index ON TABLE flight(fno)
AS 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.index.compact.CompactIndexHandler'
WITH DEFERRED REBUILD;
Creates an index on the fno column of the flight table.

12. Average Departure Delay Per Day (Assuming you add a day column)
First, alter the table to add a day column if not already present:


ALTER TABLE flight ADD COLUMNS (day STRING);
Then, query for average delay:


SELECT day, AVG(delay) AS avg_delay
FROM flight
GROUP BY day;
Let me know if your data has a date column instead of day, or if you want it grouped by full date.
